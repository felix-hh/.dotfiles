# Sets reasonable macOS defaults.
#
# Or, in other words, set shit how I like in macOS.
#
# The original idea (and a couple settings) were grabbed from:
#   https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/blob/master/.macos
#
# Run ./set-defaults.sh and you'll be good to go.

# Disable press-and-hold for keys in favor of key repeat.
defaults write -g ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool false

# Show the ~/Library folder.
chflags nohidden ~/Library

# Set a really fast key repeat.
defaults write NSGlobalDomain KeyRepeat -int 1

# Set the Finder prefs for showing a few different volumes on the Desktop.
defaults write com.apple.finder ShowExternalHardDrivesOnDesktop -bool true
defaults write com.apple.finder ShowRemovableMediaOnDesktop -bool true

# Run the screensaver if we're in the bottom-left hot corner.
defaults write com.apple.dock wvous-bl-corner -int 5
defaults write com.apple.dock wvous-bl-modifier -int 0
